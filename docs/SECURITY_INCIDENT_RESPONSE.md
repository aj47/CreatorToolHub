# Security Incident Response - API Key Leak (2025-10-12)

## Incident Summary

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Resolved  

API keys were accidentally committed to the git repository in the following files:
- `KEY_ROTATION_SUMMARY.md` (contained both old and new keys)
- `verify-key-rotation.sh` (contained old keys)

## Keys Exposed

### Old Keys (REVOKED)
- **Gemini API Key**: `AIza...` (revoked)
- **Autumn Secret Key**: `am_sk_live_...` (revoked)

### New Keys (Active)
- **Gemini API Key**: `AIza...` (active)
- **Autumn Secret Key**: `am_sk_live_...` (active)

**Note**: Actual key values are not documented here for security reasons. Refer to Cloudflare Secrets and environment configuration.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Immediate Response
- ✅ Rotated all exposed API keys
- ✅ Updated production secrets in Cloudflare
- ✅ Updated local development environment files
- ✅ Revoked old keys in service provider dashboards

### 2. Git History Cleanup
- ✅ Used `git filter-repo` to remove all instances of old keys from git history
- ✅ Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub
- ✅ Verified keys are no longer in git history

### 3. Prevention Measures
- ✅ Created pre-commit git hook to prevent committing secrets
- ✅ Created shared git-hooks directory for team collaboration
- ✅ Added setup-git-hooks.sh script for easy installation
- ✅ Updated .gitignore files to exclude all `.env*` files
- ✅ Created SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md documentation

### 4. Cleanup
- ✅ Removed KEY_ROTATION_SUMMARY.md from repository
- ✅ Removed verify-key-rotation.sh from repository
- ✅ Removed sensitive files from working directory

## Verification

### Git History Check
```bash
# Verify old keys are not in git history
git log --all -S "old_gemini_key_pattern"
git log --all -S "old_autumn_key_pattern"
# Result: No matches found ✅
```

### Working Directory Check
```bash
# Verify old keys are not in current files
grep -r "old_gemini_key_pattern" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
# Result: Not found ✅
```

### Pre-commit Hook Test
The pre-commit hook is now active and will prevent committing:
- Google API keys (AIza...)
- AWS keys (AKIA...)
- Autumn API keys (am_sk_live_...)
- Generic secret patterns (secret=, api_key=, password=, etc.)
- Private key files

## Team Communication

### For Existing Team Members
1. Pull the latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Install git hooks: `./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh`
3. Review SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md

### For New Team Members
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh` to install git hooks
3. Create `.env.local` with development keys (ask team lead)
4. Review SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never commit secrets**: Even temporary documentation files should not contain API keys
2. **Use environment variables**: All secrets should be in `.env*` files which are gitignored
3. **Automate prevention**: Git hooks catch mistakes before they're committed
4. **Document procedures**: Clear documentation helps prevent future incidents

## Future Prevention

### Automated Checks
- Pre-commit hook checks for secret patterns before commits
- CI/CD pipeline should also scan for secrets

### Manual Reviews
- Code reviews should check for hardcoded secrets
- Regular audits of git history for exposed secrets

### Team Training
- All team members should review SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md
- Regular security awareness training recommended
