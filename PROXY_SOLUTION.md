# Proxy Solution for Worker Authentication

## Problem
- Worker routes in `wrangler.toml` don't work because Cloudflare Pages handles the domain first
- Cross-domain cookies from `creatortoolhub.com` to `techfren.workers.dev` are blocked by browsers
- Need same-domain API access for authentication to work

## Solution: Next.js API Proxy

Created `/app/api/user/[...path]/route.ts` that:
1. Receives requests at `creatortoolhub.com/api/user/*`
2. Forwards them to `creator-tool-hub.techfren.workers.dev/api/user/*`
3. Includes authentication cookies in the forwarded request
4. Returns the worker response to the client

## Benefits
- ✅ Same domain = cookies work automatically
- ✅ No CORS issues
- ✅ No complex Cloudflare routing configuration needed
- ✅ Transparent to the frontend

## Environment Variable Update Needed

In Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
1. Go to Pages > creator-tool-hub > Settings > Environment variables
2. Update: `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKER_API_URL=https://creatortoolhub.com`
3. Redeploy

## How It Works

```
Frontend Request:
https://creatortoolhub.com/api/user/templates
↓
Next.js Proxy Route:
/app/api/user/[...path]/route.ts
↓
Worker Request:
https://creator-tool-hub.techfren.workers.dev/api/user/templates
↓
Worker Response:
JSON data with user templates
↓
Frontend Response:
Same JSON data, but from same domain
```

## Testing
After deployment:
1. Check that `https://creatortoolhub.com/api/user/profile` returns user data (not 404)
2. Verify no more "localStorage fallback" messages
3. Confirm cloud storage operations work
4. Test template creation/deletion
